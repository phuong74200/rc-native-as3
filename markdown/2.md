, the creator of [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), once interviewed for a software developer position at Google.

Despite being one of the most phenomenal developers, he was *rejected* by Google.

The reason? --- He could not solve a data structure question right.

He expressed his discontentment with Google's interviewing process through his tweet as below:

He also tweeted about how even Meta's software developer interview is absolutely irrelevant to what the actual job demands.

*Tell me in the comments below what are your thoughts on this?*
